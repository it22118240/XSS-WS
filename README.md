# XSS-WS
This website contains a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Participants are challenged to identify the vulnerable input fields, exploit the vulnerability, and understand how it can be used to compromise user data or session information. This room is designed to help learners recognize XSS flaws and explore methods to prevent such attacks in real-world applications.
